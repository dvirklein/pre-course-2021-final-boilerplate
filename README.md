hello!!!!
welcome to my to do lists :)
In this project i have made a to do list that makes it very easy for you to remember your list, even if you refresh it will not go away because its connect with json bin!
We added options like edit and delete so u can edit your tasks,and if your tasks is finished or still un-relevant.
The list have some nice animations that lets you notice if you hover over a button/content.
the design of the page is sort of a classic design with out any tricks,easy for the eye.
dark mode is also included.
every section in the function has her oun unic function.
